    "In all the previous labs, we were trying to design a classifier $q(\\mathbf{x}):X \\rightarrow D$ by using the a priori probabilities $p_K(k)$ and the\n",
    "probability density functions $p_{X \\vert k}(\\mathbf{x}\\vert k)$. We were minimising\n",
    "the Bayesian risk or some more complex criterion. This kind of approach is\n",
    "commonly referred to as [generative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model), because we try to estimate the full\n",
    "probabilistic model of all variables (we try to find the probabilistic model\n",
    "which “generated” the training samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, this is however not practical or even possible, e.g. it is not\n",
    "possible to get enough samples to get a good estimate of $p_{X\\vert k}(\\mathbf{x}\\vert k)$, so \n",
    "instead we try to approximate the decision function $q(\\mathbf{x})$ directly\n",
    "without any knowledge of the underlying probability distribution. This\n",
    "approach is referred to as [discriminative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminative_model), \n",
    "because we are only interested in training the classifier to make correct decisions and we do not care about\n",
    "the actual probabilistic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the discriminative approach, we define a criterion (emperical risk) $R_{\\text{emp}}(q)$ \n",
    "which estimates the risk of the classifier using the training set.\n",
    "Typically, we calculate $R_{\\text{emp}}(q)$ as the classification error of the\n",
    "classifier $q$ on a training set $\\mathcal{T}$ and we try to find a classifier $q^∗$ which\n",
